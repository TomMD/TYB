This is the Template Your Boilerplate (TYB) library.

The "Template Your Boilerplate" paper documents the design of this library
and is available at: http://cs.pdx.edu/~adamsmic/projects/tyb/TYB.pdf

The TYB library is in the Data.Generics.TH module.

The 'examples' folder contains examples of using TYB and is a good
place to start getting familiar with TYB.  They can be built with:

    $ ghc --make examples/*.hs

A couple of useful debugging helpers for Template Haskell are
included in the Debug.TH module.

We welcome feedback on both the implementation and the interface.
